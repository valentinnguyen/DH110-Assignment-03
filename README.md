## Contextual Inquiry
*by Valentin Nguyen, Spring 2021*

## Introductory Steps

### Step 01: Specify the main design challenge

#### What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?
> This project will encourage conversations between people of different age groups and would allow for anyone, no matter how well-versed they are in technology, to accessbily use the service. It will hopefully serve people who are younger as well as others who are older, especially those who are local in the Los Angeles area, to become more interested in socializing with others despite the generation gap.

#### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
> This activity will satisfy the user's basic need for interpersonal skills. Especially now during the pandemic when it is difficult to meet new people, users can have the opportunity to meet other people regardless of where they are located. This also applies to the elderly, pandemic or not, who had gone through retirement and are in need to continue exercising their interpersonal skills.

#### What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
> Current solutions to satisfying this need for practicing social and interpersonal skills exist, but are not known unless the user is specifically looking for that particular kind of service. From my own observations, those services are not widely used among people my age. If they were interested in the topic, however, they would most likely go to a nursing home and ask to volunteer. However, this need can fulfill anyone, not only the ones that are interested in it in the first place.

#### What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
> Some limitations that to this activity that can be improved with technology is more awareness and accessbility for young people to meet with the elderly and vice versa. Technology would allow those interactions to happy more quickly and efficiently, and could also provide a safety barrier between the parties via the computer screen in case any of the users are uncomfortable with meeting new people in person.

### Step 02: Target users

#### What are the characteristics of usres? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)
> Demographic: younger users ages 15 to 30 in Los Angeles who have not retired yet; elderly ages 65 to 75 in Los Angeles who have gone through the retirement process. 
> Preferences: users that have an interest and dedication to improving their impersonal skills by meeting new people with a generational gap.
> Expertise: no level of expertise will be required.

#### Where would the users do that activity?
> Users will do this activity through a website that is accessible to anyone.

#### What would the users do to complete that activity?
> The users will register through an application in order to chat with others on a one-to-one basis, ideally with someone who is on the opposite side of the age range. 

### Step 03: Pick research methods

To get a better understanding of how I could create a website that is accessible and user-friendly to different types of users, I conducted a contextual inquiry. Due to the current pandemic, this session had to be conducted remotely over Zoom.

The session consisted of the following steps:
1. Background Questions: Through these questions, I wanted to get a better idea of how the user interacts with Internet and what sorts of things they search about. I also asked questions to clarify where exactly the user goes when looking for something to search up.
2. Observations: I allowed the user to search up a topic of their choice so that I can analyze what elements on the interface they interact with. When the user would go back or redo their search, I would ask questions about why would do so.
3. Follow-up Questions: At the end of the session, I ask the user to reflect on what they searched for, and why they would use certain websites to further their search.

- Interesting insights from the interview:

#### [13:32] How did you decide on which keywords to use when searching up topics?
> I thought I should be as simple as possible. I want to be as concise as I can, either by using very simple words, or by using more complicated words so that that’s less of a word count. Because I feel like the longer I search for like, the longer the phrase than the more vague answers I can get or off topic. It’s not as accurate.

##### [16:16] How do you decide if you have found what you are looking for?
> Right. Well, I guess in this specific search, I was curious why it was the way it was. And when I got that answer, I still was not completely satisfied. Because I was curious how [I could] connect to it coming back to me, like, how does this affect my life? You know what I mean? Like, although these kids in his high school thought of this term, and they use this term, what does that have anything to do with [me]? How come I know it and why am I searching for it right now? So like, I guess a personal connection is helpful for me to realize that that's when I kept searching and then found it and then that's what says.

##### [22:45] (After asking if there were any searches for information that they found themselves repeatedly doing all the time, responds by saying they used the translating app on Safari) Why would you use the translating app on Safari instead of using the translator app on your app?
> In my mind, it's easier. Because in an app, I guess I'm just lazy, I don't want to take the extra step and try to research an app that would be a good fit, that would be free, and that would have a nice interface. Whereas I can easily go on my phone and look on the internet. And it's fairly quick. And it's accessible, because I can do it on my phone and my laptop interchangeably. You know, I don't have to, like, have an app and then download an app on the other thing. 

### Step 06: Reflection
I actually really enjoyed this inquiry process! I thought it was more free-flow and very open compared the usability testing process, and I gained a lot of insight about how to write a script and prepare questions about what goes on the user's mind. Additionally, I thought it was useful to see how other people navigate technology and their internet whenever they try to search for certain topics. Granted, the user I interviewed for this activity was of a similar demographic as me, and they happened to have similar methods of research as me. However, there was some slight differences in our methods of searcing up topics, and that was insightful to see and also hear their thought process. One difficult part of the process was that there were some points when the user would answer my question but would not clarify further, and coming up with followup questions was a bit difficult. Otherwise, I learned a lot about how a user interacts with different interfaces and how I could integrate them into my own projects.
